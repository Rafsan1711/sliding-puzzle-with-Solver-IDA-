# Sliding Puzzle Game (IDA* Hybrid Solver, Customization, and More!)

Welcome! This is a feature-rich, open-source sliding puzzle game supporting 3x3, 4x4, and 5x5 boards, a powerful hybrid IDA* solver, custom board configuration, and a modern UI.  
**Our vision:** Build the most advanced open-source sliding puzzle solver, with your help!

## üéÆ Features

- **Modern, responsive UI** ‚Äì Built with Tailwind CSS and custom styles.
- **3x3 (Easy), 4x4 (Normal), 5x5 (Hard) modes** ‚Äì Switch instantly.
- **Animated tiles** ‚Äì Sleek transitions and hover effects.
- **Hybrid Puzzle Solver** ‚Äì  
  - **3x3:** Classic IDA* (Iterative Deepening A*) algorithm.
  - **4x4:** Two-stage hybrid:
    - Stage 1: Places first 6 tiles efficiently (IDA* + BFS fallback if needed).
    - Stage 2: Solves the remaining tiles using IDA*.
  - **5x5:** Two-stage hybrid:
    - Stage 1: Places first 12 tiles (top rows and start of third row).
    - Stage 2: Solves the rest using IDA*.
- **Solver runs in Web Worker** ‚Äì UI always stays responsive.
- **Progress bar** ‚Äì See live completion percentage (custom computation for each mode).
- **Bot thinking animation** ‚Äì Animated status while solving.
- **Set Custom Position** ‚Äì  
  - Instantly place any number (or empty tile) at any cell.
  - Intuitive modal: select tile, row, and column from dropdowns (no manual typing).
  - Ensures only one empty space; prevents duplicates.
  - **Note:** Use `0` for empty.
- **Timer + Shuffle** ‚Äì  
  - 10-second visible timer below the board.
  - When timer ends, a Shuffle button appears to reshuffle the board and restart timer.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts** ‚Äì  
  - Press **B** to start the solver.
  - Press **ESC** to stop/cancel the solver.
- **Modal dialog** ‚Äì Celebrates your win!
- **Footer instructions** ‚Äì Clear troubleshooting and credits.

## üß© How 4x4 and 5x5 Solving Works

- **4√ó4:**  
  - **Stage 1:** Lock tiles 1‚Äì6 (by value, left-right, top-down) using IDA* search.  
    - If IDA* gets stuck, falls back to BFS to place the stuck tile.
  - **Stage 2:** Uses IDA* to solve the remaining tiles.
- **5√ó5:**  
  - **Stage 1:** Lock tiles 1‚Äì12 (first two rows and first two of the third row).
  - **Stage 2:** Uses IDA* on what's left.

This hybrid approach makes the solver much faster and more robust for larger boards.
